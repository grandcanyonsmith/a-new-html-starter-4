      <section>
        <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. It is used for web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting, etc.</p>
        <p>Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability, and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.</p>
        <p>The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>
        <p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems.</p>
        <p>Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller, Python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for some of the most popular operating systems, allowing for the distribution of Python-based software for use on those environments without requiring the installation of a Python interpreter.</p>
        <p>CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations.</p>
